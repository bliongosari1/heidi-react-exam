Assignment: Develop a Joke Management React Component

Objective
- Create a React component that allows users to fetch random jokes from an API, view, manage, and navigate through them. The component should also allow users to save jokes to a favorites list and manage those favorites.

Requirements

Fetching Jokes:
- Implement a button labeled "Get Random Joke" that fetches a random joke from the API: https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke.
- Display the fetched joke in a readable format.

Navigating Jokes:
- Implement "Next" and "Previous" buttons to navigate through the fetched jokes.
- Ensure the "Next" button is disabled if there are no more jokes ahead.
- Ensure the "Previous" button is disabled if there are no more jokes behind.

Managing the Joke List:
- Display the list of fetched jokes.
- Each joke in the list should have a "Remove" button that allows the user to remove the joke from the list.
- Each joke in the list should have an "Edit" button that allows the user to edit the joke.
- Implement input fields and a "Save" button for editing jokes, ensuring changes are saved and updated in the list.

Favorite Jokes:
- Implement a button labeled "Add to Favorites" that adds the currently displayed joke to a favorites list.
- Display the list of favorite jokes separately from the main joke list.
- Each favorite joke should have a "Remove from Favorites" button that allows the user to remove the joke from the favorites list.

- Fetch and manage data from an API.
- Use React state and props effectively.
- Implement basic CRUD operations in a React component.

Good luck!!
