Managing the Joke List:

- Each joke in the list should have an "Edit" button that allows the user to edit the joke.
- Implement input fields and a "Save" button for editing jokes, ensuring changes are saved and updated in the list.

Favorite Jokes:
- Implement a button labeled "Add to Favorites" that adds the currently displayed joke to a favorites list.
- Display the list of favorite jokes separately from the main joke list.
- Each favorite joke should have a "Remove from Favorites" button that allows the user to remove the joke from the favorites list.

- Fetch and manage data from an API.
